__Trello Card URL__:   (also, copy the URL of this pull request to the Trello card.)

__Notes__: Requirements or other instructions for the tester.


__Areas__: What was covered, describe the test harness used to test the system under test (SUT) and the areas of the SUT that were actually tested. Each entry in this section should be on its own line.

__Tester__: the tester’s name

__Task Breakdown__:

__Duration__: Short (30-60 mins)/Normal (60-90 mins)/Long (90-120 mins).

__Test Design and Execution__: percentage of time spent on this phase of the exploratory test.

__Bug investigation and reporting__: percentage of time spent on this phase of the exploratory test.

__Session setup__: percentage of time spent on this phase of the exploratory test.

__Charter vs. Opportunity__: Percentage of time spent on expected areas of the system under test (SUT) versus unexpected areas of the SUT
that were undertaken and tested.

__Data files__: any data that was gathered during the test, such as screen recordings, or screen shots. The path to this is acceptable

__Test Notes__: Step by step “journal” of the exploratory test. The format for this is a sentence describing what actions were taken when testing,
followed by bullets to describe the observations and steps performed to complete the action described.

__Opportunity__: this section follows the same format at the preceding ‘Test Notes’ section, but covers what unexpected opportunities were
taken during the exploratory test.

__Bugs__: What bugs were found during the exploratory test. The format is a sentence bug name, followed by a section titled: “Steps to Reproduce,” then bulleted steps, a “Expected Results:” section then an “Actual Results” section. Each bug should be numbered.
